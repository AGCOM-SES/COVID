<h3>Conclusion</h3>
     <p>
These preliminary analyses have left us with many possible interpretations but also a lot of questions. What is the typical dynamics of the <i>Searches</i> index? Unless the same query results in different output, each search is unlikely to be repeated by the same user, so a physiologic decrease is expected, but not characterized yet. And what are the influences of the different kinds of interventions on the dynamics? Some interventions seem to be linked with the rise of the interest while others seem to cause a lowering. 
</p>
<p> Of course, the interest evolution needs to be compared with the information offered by the national news outlets. How does the availability of information from national or regional news outlets influence the need for information that people try to obtain from the internet?</p>
<p>
We have also observed a strong geographical dependence on the regional and national measures taken, the sense of “closeness” influences the people’s search patterns. This leads to the question whether is it possible to profile regions upon their information needs? 
</p>
<p>Another interesting question could be: what difference in search patterns can we observe when comparing different nations? How did the governmental intervention impact the searches there?</p>
