  <h3>Searches Evolution over Time</h3>
  <p>
    In the previous graph, we show the evolution in time of the Searches index, nationwide and for each region. The value has to be interpreted as an average, so it does not depend on the regional population. By clicking on the region’s name in the legend, you can show or hide the index’s evolution for that region. Also, by clicking on the intervention dropdown list, you can overlay the timelines of the various types of interventions taken by the government.

    There are several interesting features emerging from this simple visualization which will need further investigation to be fully understood. Schematically, these are some possible interpretations:
    <ul>
      <li>Despite the first interventions dating back to the early days of January, the ignition of the interest seem to happen when the first intervention (Airport Restriction for travelers coming from China, on January the 24th);</li>
      <li>The <i>Searches</i> index kept on rising until a first peak on January the 31st, when the italian authorities declared the State of Emergency. Interestingly enough, from that moment on, the interest seems to decrease rapidly to stabilize on a relatively  low value.</li>
      <li>The real spike of the interest occurred in the crucial days of the epidemic in Italy, which was between the 21st and 23rd of February. The <i>Searches</i> index reached its maximum when the government announced to lock down several cities in northern Italy. </li>
      <li> The decrease after the maximum peak is almost as fast as the increase, and it is probably due to news and informational campaigns (like institutional communication on national TV), but this time the decrease stabilizes at a very high value, compared to the previous history.</li>
      <li> The trend inversion around the first days of March is probably linked to the national closure of all educational institutions. The index starts to grow again reaching a new maximum on the day of national lockdown (March the 9th). From that moment onward, we observe a slow but steady decrease of the interest for the topic.</li>
    </ul>
    Next we wondered how these phenomena spread through the county, so we wanted to explore the differences between the Italian regions.
