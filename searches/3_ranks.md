     As the previous panel showed regional differences, we seek to understand whether these may correspond to different information needs associated with the term "Coronavirus".
     In the following figure, we investigate the searches of coronavirus-related queries, at national and regional level, and how their weekly ranking evolves over time. Note that Google Trends’ data were preprocessed to merge different keywords pointing at a semantically same query.

    We observe that the top searched queries in a region correspond to the words "News", "Italia" (i.e. Italy), the same region's name, and its main cities, suggesting that people seek information about the epidemic spread near where they live. The same pattern emerges at the national level, with only the most populated cities appearing among the top queries.
    While sharing the main trend, some searches associated with coronavirus highlight differences between regions. For example, the word "Cina" (i.e. China) was more searched in Veneto and Lazio than Campania, and so "Maps" was not queried in Campania or Puglia as much as in Veneto and Lombardia.
    Interestingly, "Autocertificazione" (i.e. self-certification) was highly searched in regions such as Veneto or Toscana, compared to Lombardia, Lazio and Campania.
