    <p> Handling a critical and unprecedented emergency in the Information Age always involves crucially the Information Dynamics layer of the problem. In the case of the COVID-19 emergency, understanding multiple aspects of information dynamics has become crucial. What are the informational needs of a population confronted with an emergency situation? How are the needs evolving with time? How are they influenced by institutional interventions? How are these informational needs spreading geographically? These are just some of the initial questions our team is tackling. </p>
    <p>In this preliminary and still ongoing study, we introduce the first metric we will use to address this challenge and to visualize their evolution in time and space as well as from a semantic point of view. The main metric we introduce is the <i>Searches</i> index which gives us insights about the popularity of top search queries in Google Search across various regions and languages. This index is obtained from data that can be extracted from <a href="https://trends.google.com">Google Trends</a>. These data are proportional to the amount of queries done by Google search engine users. </p>
    <p>We chose Italy as a case study and started by downloading data relative to the searches for the term <i>"coronavirus"</i> in Italy since January the 1st, 2020. We used as reference the nationwide <i>searches</i> normalized on a scale form 0 to 100 ( maximum peak is reached on February the 23rd, 2020). All the other regional indices are rescaled according their relative importance compared to the national result. Furthermore, we also looked at related queries, what words people searched together with the term "coronavirus". We consider this search index as a reasonable proxy for the informational need of the Italian population during the COVID emergency.
